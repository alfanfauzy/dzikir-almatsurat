# Al-Ma’tsurat – Dzikir Pagi & Sore 🌅🌙

A simple, lightweight, and ad-free web app to help Muslims recite daily _dzikir_ (remembrances) in the morning and evening.  
Built for focus, speed, and a clean user experience — with PWA support so you can use it offline like a native app.

## 💻 Tech Stack

-   `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` (Vanilla)
-   `Service Worker` (for PWA support)
-   `Lucide Icons` – modern and lightweight icon set
-   `JSON` – used for dynamic dzikir content
-   `Mobile-first` responsive layout


## 🧠 Motivation
I built this because most dzikir apps are either too heavy, full of ads, or have poor UX.
This project aims to provide a better experience: minimal, responsive, and spiritually focused ✨
